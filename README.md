##Overview

Cleanup City is an app that helps residents to identify public safety, environmental issues, upload pictures and report them for resolution.

**"A picture tells thousand words"**

Cleanup City is a collaborative platform that gives an opportunity for residents, neighborhood groups and associations to focus on cleaning, greening and organize events for the city clean up.

## Motivation

I always find myself wondering, about the dirty stairs or the broken parking meters while I am walking down the streets of San Francisco, it would be helpful if there was a system to keep people aware of the areas that needs to be taken care. This led to the creation of [**CleanupCity**](http://cleanupcity.herokuapp.com/)

* To encourage residents take ownership of their communities.
* To provide opportunities and organize events for community improvement activities.
* To promote leadership for greening, maintenance and environmentally supportive efforts.
* To report issues and resolution in a timely manner.
